# Tourist Places in South India
South India connects me with the exquisitely architectured ancient temples and the beautiful setting where the South Indian women are seen in traditional silk sarees draped elegantly and men wearing a white sarong like garment (Lungi or Mundu in Kerala) with white shirts are laid-back and welcoming towards each other and the tourists. The palm-fringed canals, spirituality, and pristine beaches are some of the reasons that make the discerning travelers a chance to wander to the unfailing and unbeatable tranquility of the gorgeous places in South India. So here is the list of top 4 tourist destinations that you can choose to plan an interesting South India tour.
| Location | Number Of Hours | Money |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kerala | 72 | 150$ |
| Kanyakumari | 24 | 100$ |
| Mysore | 5 | 50$ |
| Tirupathi | 10 | 50$ |
